{% if type %}The item type is: {{ type }}.{% endif %}

Generate a flat list of 8–25 lower-case keywords that describe:
- Physical objects and their materials (e.g. "felt", "embroidery", "paper")
- Activities or events depicted
- Era, decade, or style (e.g. "1940s", "art-deco", "victorian")
- Colours (only dominant/notable ones)
- Subject matter and themes
- Safety classification (safe | questionable | unsafe)

Rules:
- Single words or short hyphenated phrases only
- All lower-case, no proper names (those go in people_and_places)
- Deduplicated

Return structured JSON only.
